Working with this app
===

#### If you are NOT working on the design

Then you just need to get the HTML & SCSS files. To do that just run:

```
gulp yourFiles
```

Gulp will create a folder called `yourFiles` in the root of the project where you'll have:

```
views/
	component/
		component.html
		component.scss
bower.json
```

Grab your files and put them inside your actual project.

#### If you ARE working on the design

Then you know what to do, just run:

`npm install && bower install`

And start coding.
