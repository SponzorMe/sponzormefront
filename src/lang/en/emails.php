    Hi,
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    My name is Carlos and I’m the founder of SponzorMe. I’m reaching out to say thank you for joining us! This project was born out of a necessity that I had
    myself every time I would organize an event, and it is a problem that can end with a community and the enthusiasm of its organizers. Please take a moment
    to read more about what motivates me and the team behind SponzorMe <a href="http://blogen.sponzor.me/">http://blogen.sponzor.me/</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    As you know this is a journey and there are many unknowns so I need your help, any comment, suggestion, trouble or feedback that you have is welcome. I’m
    here to help.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    You can get in touch with me personally at <a href="mailto:carlos@sponzor.me">carlos@sponzor.me</a>
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Please verify your email to get started with the following link:',
